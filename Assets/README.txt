Game Overview: Creature care game where the player is trying to get their slime to live as long as possible. Inorder to keep the slime healthy and happy the player must play arcade style minigames to win items. Items will have values which may increase or decrease health and happiness. 

How to Play: Start the game and create a slime. Enter the slimes name and choose its color. After you save you are in the slime care scene. To play minigames open the mini game menu and select which game to play. To use items open the inventory by pressing the items icon, then select an available item to view its details for how it will affect the slimes health and happiness. Click the use button to feed it to your slime.

How to Play Plinko: Press the left and right arrow buttons to move the slime's drop position to a desired location. Then press the slime icon in between the arrow buttons to drop the slime. At this point which prize slot the slime falls in is completely random and based on how it bounces off the walls and pegs. After it falls in a slot you are presented with the item it won and then press the return button to go back to the care scene.

How to Play Skeeball: Initially the slime will move left and right and the player is required to single tap the screen once to stop the slime at that position. Next, the slime will rotate left and right and touching the screen will stop the rotation and set the launch angle. Finally, a power bar will show up and move from no power to full power. Touching the screen once will lock in the amount of power applied to the slime. The goal is to line up the slime and apply the necessary power to hit a desired bucket. Each bucket is worth a varying amount of points with the most valuable bucket being the smaller ones off to the side of the furthest middle bucket. Then the next most valuable is the furthest bucket in the center, followed by the subsequent buckets moving closer to the slimes start position.

How to Play Slimehole: To launch the slime the player needs to provide a swipe gesture to the screen. Depending on how straight up and down the slime is will vary its flight path. If the gesture is not straight up and down then the slime will fly off to the left or right. Also the length and speed of the swipe will add to the length of the flight path. The goal being to swipe centered-vertically with the appropriate length and speed to get the slime in the hole on the board. Getting the slime on the board is worth a single point, getting the slime in the hole is worth four total points. If the slime lands on the board then falls off the player loses the point it would have gained if the slime stopped on the board.
